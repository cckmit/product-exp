Select a fund with a risk level that suits you and with an investment objective that matches your goals.</li>\n<li>Extraordinary events may affect the processing of a redemption order, causing delays for payments to be made to Investor.

Investor is advised to keep records of his/her investments in these funds, including other records as evidence that unitholders have fully complied with the terms and conditions of these funds.
